Columns:

- Files LambdaGalaxiesz*_RefL100N1504.dat: 

1) GroupNumber: identifies host halo
2) SubGroupNumber: identifies substructe in the host halo (=0 for centrals, >0 for satellite)
3) Stellar_Mass: of the galaxy in Msun
4) SFR: star formation rate of the galaxy in Msun/yr
5) LambdaR: lambdaR at the r-band r50 with the galaxy oriented edge-on 
6) LambdaR_r: lambdaR at the r-band r50 with the galaxy seen through the xy axes of the simulated box (hence, random)
7) r50_Lum: effective radius of the r-band in kpc
8) r50_stars: effective radius of the stars in kpc
9) VS: rotational to dispersion velocity ratio calculated with ALL the stars in the galaxy
10) jstar: stellar specific angular momentum computed at the r-band r50 with the galaxy oriented edge-on in km/s * kpc
11) jstar_r: stellar specific angular momentum computed at the r-band r50 with the galaxy seen through the xy axes of the simulated box (hence, random) in km/s * kpc
12) epsilon: ellipticity measured at the r-band r50 with the galaxy oriented edge-on
13) epsilon_r: ellipticity measured at the r-band r50 with the galaxy seen through the xy axes of the simulated box (hence, random)
14) sigma: velocity dispersion measured at the r-band r50 with the galaxy oriented edge-on
15) sigma_r: velocity dispersion measured at the r-band r50 with the galaxy seen through the xy axes of the simulated box (hence, random)

A combination (GroupNumber, SubGroupNumber, Snapshot) uniquely identifies a galaxy. Because there are different files for each redshift, a galaxy in each file is uniquely identified with (GroupNumber, SubGroupNumber).

- File GroupNumberHistory.dat and SubGroupNumberHistory.dat:
This contains the history of GroupNumber and SubGroupNumber of galaxies. You can use this (GroupNumber, SubGroupNumber) to see what the progenitors are of each galaxy at z=0 (column of snapshot 28) at any snapshot in the past. Files have the same order, so line j in both files correspond to the same galaxy.

- File MergerRatioHistory: indicates whether galaxies have gone through a merger and the merger ratio involved. This gile has the same order as tables GroupNumberHistory.dat and SubGroupNumberHistory.dat.

- DatabaseInfoRefL100N1504_LambdaStudy.dat: information of groupmass, position/velocity of galaxies, and magnitudes. Note that these magnitudes are rest-frame absolute AB magnitude that do not include the effects of dust.
